Loop through JavaScript object: stringfy
===================================

I have a JavaScript object like the following

 var p =
    {
        "p1": "value1",
        "p2": "value2",
        "p3": "value3"
    };


You can use the for-in loop as shown by others. However, you also want to make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype:

for (var key in p) {
  if (p.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    alert(key + " -> " + p[key]);
  }
}


Would propose that you change the alert line just for clarity to alert(key + " -> " + JSON.stringify(p[key]));

Under ECMAScript 5, you can combine Object.keys() and Array.prototype.forEach():

    var obj = { first: "John", last: "Doe" };
    // Visit non-inherited enumerable keys
    Object.keys(obj).forEach(function(key) {
        console.log(key);
    });
