How to iterate through multiple rows in jquery using ajax, json, and php
=========================================================================
REF LINK : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8449860/how-to-iterate-through-multiple-rows-in-jquery-using-ajax-json-and-php


I have a php page that returns json like this:

while ($row = oci_fetch_array($stid, OCI_ASSOC+OCI_RETURN_NULLS)) {
        $rows[] = $row;
}
print json_encode($rows);

When I run the php page I get back something like:

[{"phone":"1234567"},{"phone":"1234567"}]

 $.ajax({
        url: 'test.php',
        type: 'POST',
        dataType: 'json',
        contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
        success: function(response) {

             $.each(response, function() { 
                $.each(this, function(key, value){
                    alert(key + " --> " + value); 
                });
            });

        }
   });

});

I got that from another SO question. This will give me my keys and value in the alert. This was just for me to make sure everything works. I have searched but cannot figure out how to just get one value. Say I wanted the name, what do I put? I have tried:

success: function(response) {
 var obj = $.parseJSON(response);
 alert( obj.phone );
}

But since it is multiple rows it won't work unless I have, and it also fails when I have one row like this:

echo json_encode(array("phone" => "123")

The response variable is an array of objects. To access a single index in your response variable:

var phone = response[0].phone;//replace `0` with the index you want
If you end-up iterating through your response in a loop make sure to do it like this for the best performance:

var len = response.length;
for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    console.log(response[i].phone);
}
Check-out this jsperf to see how much faster this type of loop is than for(i in array): http://jsperf.com/for-in-tests
