XAMPP, Apache - Error: Apache shutdown unexpectedly

I've just reinstaled XAMPP... + when I try to start my Apache server in the Control Panel I now get following errors:

16:50:25  [Apache]  Status change detected: running
16:50:26  [Apache]  Status change detected: stopped
16:50:26  [Apache]  Error: Apache shutdown unexpectedly.
16:50:26  [Apache]  This may be due to a blocked port, missing dependencies, 
16:50:26  [Apache]  improper privileges, a crash, or a shutdown by another method.
16:50:26  [Apache]  Press the Logs button to view error logs and check
16:50:26  [Apache]  the Windows Event Viewer for more clues
16:50:26  [Apache]  If you need more help, copy and post this
16:50:26  [Apache]  entire log window on the forums

SOLUTION:



If you are using the latest Skype, go to Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> connection. 

Disable the "Use port 80 and 443 for alternatives for incoming connections"

Sign Out and Close all Skype windows. Try restart your Apache again.

SOLUTION #2

open your xampp control panel then click its "config"
choose the "Apache (httpd.conf)" and find this code below and change it into this one:

#Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below

#to prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

#Listen 0.0.0.0:80

#Listen [::]:80

Listen 80

# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support

save it (ctrl + s)
after that, go back to xampp control panel and click again its config
choose "Apache (httpd-ssl.conf)" find this code below and change it again:
# Note: Configurations that use IPv6 but not IPv4-mapped addresses need two

# Listen directives: "Listen [::]:443" and "Listen 0.0.0.0:443"

#

#Listen 0.0.0.0:443

#Listen [::]:443

Listen 443

save it (ctrl + s)
then, click the "config" (note: above the netstat) and click the "service and port settings" then save both of it.
finally, go to the "control panel" -> "Programs & Features" -> "Turn Windows On or Off".
Uncheck your "Internet Information Services" then click ok.
just wait for it and your computer/laptop will be automatically restart and try to open again your xampp control panel then start your Apache.
